# Hello-world
Just a test of repository...
My name is Nikita, I'm 17 and I'm from Ukraine. I wanna be a java developer and I'm learning java at the moment.
I left university cause I need some money. So now i'm working like 9-10 hours everyday (except saturday and sunday) and rest of my time I spending with my girlfriend or with HeadFirstJava book or with JavaRush (I like it. Thinking about buying a sub).
